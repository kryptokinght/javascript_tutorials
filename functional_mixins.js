//prefer object composition over class inheritance.
/*
Functional mixins are a form of object composition.
You can create object without classes in JavaScript. So after creating an object
You can add features to that object like you add ingredients to an icecream.
Javascript supports dynamic object extension, you can extend an object by dynamically
adding features to it.
